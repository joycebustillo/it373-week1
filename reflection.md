Here's the challenges I encountered during the set up and how I solved them. First, my internet wasn't working well, so it took time to download like django, python and other applications needed for my set up. Then, I had trouble activating the virtual environment in VS Code, it gave me a strange error about scripts being disabled. I didn't know what to do! I tried to fix it, but I couldn't. Luckily, a classmate helped me. I'm happy they did, or I'd still be stuck.
 
I also learned that you have to be very careful when writing a code. I made a small mistake like just one little quotation mark ( ' ) in the wrong spot and it caused a big problem, when i run it, it said "error". It taught me that even small errors can mess things up. So for now on, I'll check my code extra carefully to make sure everything's fine. It's all part of learning, i guess!
